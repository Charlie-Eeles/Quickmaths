## Brief Summary
Quick maths is a simple project I made for easily practicing and refreshing your memory on multiplication tables.
It also works to wake your brain up with simple equations.

## What's it made of?
Quick Math's is a React project.
I chose react because I like using React state for dynamically updating game timers, scores, etc.

## How do you play?
If you want to play on Github Pages:
    Click on the Github Pages link or go to: https://charlie-eeles.github.io/Quickmaths/
    Enter you the table you want to practice (current limits are set to 2-20) or leave the table blank to randomise for every question.
    Include division if you want to switch it up and stay one your toes.
    Click the start button.
    Enter the answer (It checks the input field, you don't need to press enter) if the answer is right, your score will go up and it'll pose a new question.
    If you get an answer right you gain two seconds, if the timer runs out it's game over.
    If you didn't set a table and included division it'll save a highscore.

If you want to play on a local React server:
    Clone the repo.
    Open quickmaths/quickmaths in your terminal.
    Run "npm install" to build a node_modules folder.
    Run "npm start" to start a dynamically updating local server.
