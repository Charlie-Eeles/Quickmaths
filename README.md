## Brief Summary
Quick maths is a simple project I made for easily practicing and refreshing your memory on multiplication tables.
It also works to wake your brain up with simple equations.

## What's it made of?
Quick Math's is a React project.
I chose react because I like using React state for dynamically updating game timers, scores, etc.

## How do you play?
<h3>If you want to play on Github Pages:</h3>
    - Click on the Github Pages link or go to: https://charlie-eeles.github.io/Quickmaths/ <br/>
    - Enter the table you want to practice (current limits are set to 2-20) or leave the table blank to randomise for every question. <br/>
    - Include division if you want to switch it up and stay one your toes. <br/>
    - Click the start button. <br/>
    - Enter the answer (It checks the input field, you don't need to press enter) if the answer is right, your score will go up and it'll pose a new question. <br/>
    - If you get an answer right you gain two seconds, if the timer runs out it's game over. <br/>
    - If you didn't set a table and included division it'll save a highscore. <br/>

<h3>If you want to play on a local React server:</h3>
    - Clone the repo. <br/>
    - Open quickmaths/quickmaths in your terminal. <br/>
    - Run "npm install" to build a node_modules folder. <br/>
    - Run "npm start" to start a dynamically updating local server. <br/>
